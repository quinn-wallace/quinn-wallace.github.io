My name is Quinn, and I’m a Highland dance teacher. I began dancing when I was 4 years old and started competing in Highland games shortly afterwards. I trained with teachers in Portland, Oregon and Austin, Texas, and in 2010, I qualified for and attended the United States Inter-Regional Championships as a Southwest Representative, the highest level of competition in the U.S. Now, I am a certified Member of the [British Association of Teachers of Dancing (BATD)][1], so students who learn with me are eligible to compete, if they choose to do so.

In addition to Highland dance, I have learned, competed, and performed in a diversity of dance forms and groups. I have continually returned to Highland Dance for its community of dancers and teachers, the creative connection to my heritage, and the exciting challenges that it presents to me as a dancer. 

I’m looking forward to learning with you!
